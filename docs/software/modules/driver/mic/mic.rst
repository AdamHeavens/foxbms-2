Measurement IC API
==================

|foxbms| supports various measurement ICs from different manufacturers as shown
in :ref:`SUPPORTED_MEASUREMENT_ICS`.
This is achieved by drivers that implement the Measurement IC API (MIC API).

This document describes how the MIC API works.

An example how to implement a new MIC API compatible driver is shown in
:ref:`HOW_TO_IMPLEMENT_A_NEW_MEASUREMENT_IC_DRIVER`.
