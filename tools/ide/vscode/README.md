# VS Code Setting Configuration

The files in this directory contain *configuration* files for VS Code settings.
These files get properly configured when running ``waf.bat configure`` or
``waf.sh configure`` in the root of the repository.
Please note that doing so, will overwrite the contents of `.vscode/` in
the root of the repository with these templates.
